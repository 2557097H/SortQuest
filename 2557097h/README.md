# SortQuest

'SortQuest' is a game-based learning tool which teaches sorting algorithms, namely, bubble sort, quick sort, and merge sort. It was made as part of my Level 4 Project using Unity. This repository contains all the features/files used in 'SortQuest'.

Please make sure you are authenticated with a UofG account and:

1. Download SortQuestFullGame.zip above

2. Unzip the folder

3. Start the SortQuest.exe file to play the game.

## Game Build Instructions (Can be ignored if you play the game using the above method)

1. Download Unity Game Engine, at least the 2023 version as that is what was used to create 'SortQuest'

2. IMPORTANT: Clone the src folder from this repository: (Please note that the source code can only be built and run from this full repository. This was created because the zip file of this full repository was 1GB and moodle only accepts 100mb, thus I had to take out the FireBase configuration and other dependent files to reduce this zip file to less than 100MB)

3. Launch Unity and go to Projects then Add, find the unzipped project and then launch it
4. Navigate to file then build and run, then drag all scenes from the scenes folder into the build settings
5. Click Build and Run, then run the SortQuest.exe file in the location you chose for the build to be put at

## File structure 
Assets contains the majority of useful files in the project, such as my code which is in the scripts in the script folder, and my scenes which are in the scenes folder. Nearly all the folders have a .meta file along with them generated by unity, these can be ignored.
